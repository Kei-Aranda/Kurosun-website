                The founding members of Kurosun are avid gamers and artists with a love for technology and esports. This combined experience was utilized to craft our products piece by piece - not letting any detail slip by.

                We didn’t want to stop at creating great products, though. Making sure others enjoyed them as much as we did meant we had to think outside the box. We wanted you to feel the care and thoughtful touches that we’ve put into every piece. We really believe that aesthetics don’t have to come at the cost of performance, and that philosophy will always be at the root of everything we do. <br><br>

                        <p>Polyester fabric - a durable fabric that's resistant to humidity & temperature changes. The edge stitching is carefully stitched around the edges to prevent fraying. It is kept on an even level with the surface so it stays out of the way of your mouse and doesn't bother your arm. The base is a newly developed material that offers higher quality than typical rubber, allowing for a firm, relatively thin base that lays completely flat and grips your desk.</p>

                     <p>Do not fold the mousepad, this can cause the surface to crease. Do not use a washing machine or detergent. To clean it, use a damp washcloth or a microfiber cloth. Wipe in a circular motion. Dry with a towel or washcloth, and then let air dry for 20 minutes. Repeat as needed. Do not use your nails or a brush, as those can damage the surface.</p>

                <div class="contenido-acordeon">
                    <p>Eventually, yes. The pad has a “break-in” period and after about 50-75 hours of use it will reach its intended speed. With proper care, it will maintain this glide for a long time. This process is normal. Our mousepads are lab-tested to make sure they meet our standards. Ninja was tested for over 200km (124 freedom miles) of use with simulated gamer sweat. Yes, we're serious.</p>

                <strong>
                            "Ninja is a speed-focused mousepad made to meet our exceptionally high standards of both performance and aesthetics. The tightly woven polyester fabric is resistant to humidity and temperature, resulting in an impossibly smooth surface that is best described as gliding on a cloud. We use the highest grade ink to achieve a beautifully detailed print - without affecting the glide. Underneath that, a newly developed foam creates a foundation that gives the Ninja a supportive yet firm feel, making every swipe feel the same - while the base secures it to your desk to ensure it lays completely flat. White stitched edges create a stunning border effect that ties it all together, resulting in a striking yet elegant look." </strong>
