    <h2>About</h2> <br><br>
    <p> Kurosun is dedicated to making premium, high-performance products with elegant      designs that fit any setup. Japanese-inspired visuals accompany innovative ideas to ensure a unique experience, with uncompromising passion being at the forefront of everything we do. <br> 
        
        The founding members of Kurosun are avid gamers and artists with a love for technology and esports. This combined experience was utilized to craft our products piece by piece - not letting any detail slip by. We were set on creating something we’d be exceptionally proud of, because “Pursue Perfection” is more than a slogan to us - it’s how we operate. <br>
        
        We didn’t want to stop at creating great products, though. Making sure others enjoyed them as much as we did meant we had to think outside the box. We wanted you to feel the care and thoughtful touches that we’ve put into every piece. We really believe that aesthetics don’t have to come at the cost of performance, and that philosophy will always be at the root of everything we do. <br><br>
        
        So go on, pursue perfection. <br><br>
        
        Sincerely,<br>
        Kurosun Team

                What is the Ninja mousepad made out of?
            </label>
            <div class="contenido-acordeon">
                <p>Polyester fabric - a durable fabric that's resistant to humidity & temperature changes. The edge stitching is carefully stitched around the edges to prevent fraying. It is kept on an even level with the surface so it stays out of the way of your mouse and doesn't bother your arm. The base is a newly developed material that offers higher quality than typical rubber, allowing for a firm, relatively thin base that lays completely flat and grips your desk.</p>

             <p>No, the entire surface of the mousepad is ink-printed to ensure the highest quality and consistency.</p>

            How do I care for my mousepad?
         </label>
         <div class="contenido-acordeon">
             <p>Do not fold the mousepad, this can cause the surface to crease. Do not use a washing machine or detergent. To clean it, use a damp washcloth or a microfiber cloth. Wipe in a circular motion. Dry with a towel or washcloth, and then let air dry for 20 minutes. Repeat as needed. Do not use your nails or a brush, as those can damage the surface.</p>

            Will my mousepad slow down?
        </label>
        <div class="contenido-acordeon">
            <p>Eventually, yes. The pad has a “break-in” period and after about 50-75 hours of use it will reach its intended speed. With proper care, it will maintain this glide for a long time. This process is normal. Our mousepads are lab-tested to make sure they meet our standards. Ninja was tested for over 200km (124 freedom miles) of use with simulated gamer sweat. Yes, we're serious.</p>
